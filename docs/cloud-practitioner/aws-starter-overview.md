## AWS Global Infrastructure üåç

![AWS Global Map](../assets/images/aws_global_infrastructure_map.png)

### Structure

The AWS global infrastructure consists of:

| Component                  | Description                                                                                             |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Region**                 | A physical location in the world that contains multiple, isolated Availability Zones.                   |
| **Availability Zone (AZ)** | A collection of one or more data centers in a Region with independent power, cooling, and connectivity. |
| **Edge Location**          | Used by **Amazon CloudFront** for caching and content delivery to end users with low latency.           |

### 2025 Statistics (as of October 2025)

- 38 AWS Regions
- 120+ Availability Zones
- 450+ CloudFront Edge Locations
- 20+ Wavelength & Local Zones for ultra-low latency compute

### Example

If your workload is in the **US East (N. Virginia)** Region, it may use AZs like `us-east-1a`, `us-east-1b`, etc.

## shared responsibility model üîê

![AWS Shared Responsibility Diagram](../assets/images/aws_shared_responsibility_model.png)

### Definition

The **AWS Shared Responsibility Model** defines how **security and compliance responsibilities** are divided between AWS and the customer.

- **AWS is responsible for security _of_ the cloud**  
  (physical, network, and hypervisor layers)
- **The customer is responsible for security _in_ the cloud**  
  (data, applications, encryption, IAM roles, and configurations)

### AWS Responsibilities

- Physical infrastructure and facilities
- Network and hardware maintenance
- Virtualization, hypervisor, and host operating systems
- Global service resilience and patching

### Customer Responsibilities

- Identity and access management (IAM policies, MFA)
- OS and application-level patching
- Network configurations and firewall rules
- Encryption of data at rest and in transit
- Data classification and compliance controls

## Identity and Access Management (IAM) üß©

![AWS IAM Structure](../assets/images/aws_iam_model_diagram.png)

### AWS IAM Overview

**AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)** enables secure access control to AWS services and resources.  
It lets you define _who_ can access _what_ resources and _how_.

### Core Concepts

| Component    | Description                                                     |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Users**    | Individual identities representing people/applications.         |
| **Groups**   | Collections of users with shared permissions.                   |
| **Roles**    | Temporary credentials for trusted entities (e.g., EC2, Lambda). |
| **Policies** | JSON documents that define permissions.                         |

### Example: Basic IAM Policy

```bash
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:GetObject",
        "s3:PutObject"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::mybucket/*"
    }
  ]
}

```

This policy allows the entity to read/write objects inside `mybucket` on Amazon S3.
